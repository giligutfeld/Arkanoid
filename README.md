# Arkanoid

Final product of a 5-part-semester project in Java.
This project was coded as a five-part ongoing assignment on the 2nd semester of my 1st year at BIU. I recently made a redo to parts of it to further sharpen and develop my OOP practices and Java language knowledge.
This project was coded using a single thread, which is rare for games such as this. Also, it uses no Java GUI Built-In objects, instead, I used a GUI implementation which is included in this repository.

## Compiling and Running
You must have Java SE 10 or higher installed on your machine.
You can download the added _Arkanoid.jar_ (located [here](https://github.com/matanmkl/Arkanoid/tree/master/out/artifacts/Arkanoid "This path skips through empty directories")). run it and play around :).
Also, you can download the entire source code and run the gameLevel via any Java IDEA, if you do be sure to also download the provided _biuoop-1.4.jar_ (located [here](https://github.com/matanmkl/Arkanoid/tree/master/BIU%20Stuff)).
