# Arkanoid

This project was coded as a five-part ongoing assignment on the 2nd semester of my 1st year at BIU.
This project was coded using a single thread, which is rare for games such as this. Also, it uses no Java GUI Built-In objects, instead, I used a GUI implementation which is included in this repository.

## Compiling and Running
You must have Java SE 10 or higher installed on your machine.
You can download the added _Arkanoid.jar_ (located [here](https://github.com/matanmkl/Arkanoid/tree/master/out/artifacts/Arkanoid "This path skips through empty directories")). run it and play around :).
Also, you can download the entire source code and run the gameLevel via any Java IDE.

We will be adding the following capabilities:

## The Goal
-	Remove all blocks in each level by striking them with the ball

## The Game Rules
-	Blocks with a green frame will surprise you.
- You have only 3 lives, so use them carefully!
-  You can get a little rest by pressing on the key 'p'.
- Whenever you clear all the blocks on one level, you move to another, more challenging one. 
- The score should carry on from level to level. If you finish the last level, you win the game.
